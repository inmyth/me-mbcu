                     I've building full stack, Android and system apps since 2009. During Bitcoin boom I was busy hacking Ripple blockchain.

                <p>
                    I currently code in Scala, sometimes Java and JS. There are countless stacks and frameworks I have worked with: Vue, Docker, Hadoop, Kafka, AWS and GCP stuff, etc. But in the era of software revolution where things come and go fast I believe what matters is adaptability. I wouldn't go far if I were stuck in a comfort zone. I'm always curious and eager to learn to face any challenges. Feel free to browse my portfolio or to <a href="#contact-me">contact me</a> to see how I can help you.

                <h2>Market making bots</h2>
                <p>
                    Market making is a trading technique that places buy and sell orders simultaneously and profits from bid-offer spread. In short, buy low sell high. Automating the trades is the job for bot which requires speed and robustness. There were two bots developed:
                </p>

                <h4>For Ripple network</h4>
                <p><a href="https://ripple.com/">Ripple</a> blockchain allows trades of arbitrary assets. As such it can be deployed as off-the-shelves crypto exchange. This bot was built on behalf of such exchange to provide liquidity for its users to trade. It maintains in-memory states which are asynchronously modified by trades, cancellations, and other actions. <a href="https://github.com/inmyth/mmm-java">Source at Github</a></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coded in Java</li>
                    <li>Worked with RxJava and synchronized blocks for concurrency</li>
                    <li>Operates on Ripple network with websocket</li>
                    <li>Features error failsafes to keep the bot running uninterrupted</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>For independent exchanges</h4>
                <p>Similar to the first one but operates on crypto exchanges such as HitBTC, Okex, etc. <a href="https://github.com/inmyth/akka-integrated-mmm">Source at Github</a>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Coded in Scala</li>
                        <li>Adopting Scala's functional programming resulted in reduced code base and complexity</li>
                        <li>Utilized Akka Actor to simplify multi-threading arrangement</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The video below illustrates the bot's account during operation on Ripple Net. It starts from seeding to countering trades and replacing consumed offers.

                    <p>An app to search for product and service in an area. The core of the system is the new MySql 5.7 geospatial type that allows native query on geographic location. The system comprises of Android client and cloud-based full stack. The back-end in particular makes use of Vert.x and Scala for speed and simplicity.</p>

                    <h2>Farming prediction app</h2>
                    <p>For farmers, maximizing profit isn't the same as maximizing yield. Although crops are restricted by season, there's a variation in timing influenced by demand that may result in better market price. This project was to predict potential opportunities (as well as losses) using mathematical tools and machine learning for agriculture region in Kyushu, Japan. It was supported by IBM and eventually acquired and co-developed with Softbank. <a href="http://www.maff.go.jp/j/seisan/gizyutu/hukyu/h_event/attach/pdf/smaforum-48.pdf">Press release by Japan Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery.</a></p>

								<h2>Futures Made Easy with Scala</h2>
                <p>
                    Concurrency is never easy to work with. But not with Scala. Unlike other languages, Scala Futures enables composition of sequential or parallel asynchronous executions easily. <a href="https://medium.com/free-code-camp/futures-made-easy-with-scala-da1beb3bb281">Read the rest at FreeCodeCamp.</a></p>
										
                <h2>An introduction to Vert.x, the fastest Java framework today</h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js is server framework that famously uses a single core to process million requests easily. JVM is Java Virtual Machine that distributes process among cores. What if those two are combined ? </p>
                <p>
                    Introducing Vert.x, a microservice framework that has been <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17&hw=cl&test=fortune"> dominating performance benchmarks</a>. It is also very simple. Comparing it with de-facto Java frameworks like Spring or Play is like comparing a truck with a Ferrari. In this article I'm suggesting coupling Vert.x with Scala Future as it makes concurrency work a breeze. <a href="https://medium.com/free-code-camp/an-introduction-to-vert-x-the-fastest-java-framework-today-27d8661ceb14">Read the rest at FreeCodeCamp.</a>

                <h2>If youâ€™re still using Synchronized, you should try Akka Actor instead</h2>
                <p>
                    In the Java world, synchronized is the conventional way of doing concurrency. Looking in retrospect, it's probably one reason why people were scared of multi-threading. Synchronized is basically a locking mechanism to prevent multiple threads from modifying a state at the same time, a scenario knows as race condition. The problem is managing the lock is massively difficult. Actor is a concurrency model that solves this issue by lining up all inputs in a queue. As the messages are digested one-by-one the state can be altererd safely without the need for locks. <a href="https://medium.com/free-code-camp/still-using-synchronized-try-akka-actor-instead-ac2f2b22a9ed">Read the rest at FreeCodeCamp.</a>

                <h2>Introduction to Blockhain</h2>
                <p>
                    Bitcoin, blockchain...all the things fueling crypto frenzy. Like probably half of the people on this planet, I too was drawn into it. This article was sort of a learning experience in my attempt to make sense of the technology. If I had to summarize the fundamentals of cryptocurrency in one word, it'd be "hash". It's amazing that someone, "Satoshi", managed to upend financial world with a simple property of hashing algorithm. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quick-introduction-blockchain-martin-utama/">Read the rest at Linkedin.</a>
